# blazetype - WPM, blazing fast

The project that I'm building for this iteration of Hack Club is blazetype, a project
inspired by [Monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com) that measures your WPM. That in and of
itself isn't that interesting. However, blazetype aims to provide a CLI (because I love
CLIs) and some social features.

## Project structure

- `server` - the blazetype server, which provides the API for the service (written in Go)
- `cli` - the cli (written in Rust)
